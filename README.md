# Ideaworks

Ideaworks is a free and open source web application that allows a group of people to collate, comment on and rate ideas. The application also has
allows staff users to create projects, small packages of work that have developed from the ideas. 

It was initially designed and built by the UK Defence Science & Technology Laboratory (dstl) and released under AGPL as a prototype tool. Ideaworks was the first piece of software to be released onto Github because of its simplicity, low risk and potential benefit to the Free and Open Source software community - particularly those organising hackathons.

We don’t pretend that the code is the best ever written (see NOTICE.md and LICENSE.md for the disclaimers), but please use it as you see fit, file bugs and enhancement issues (of which we’ll be adding a few outstanding). We very much welcome pull requests. 

The application is split into 2 parts:

1. A django project which provides the data API back-end and user authentication.
2. A responsive design html/js/css front-end.
